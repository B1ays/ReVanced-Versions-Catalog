# Feat

- Bring back a switch toggle for `Premium header` in the Settings by @rufusin.
- Bump YouTube version up to `19.09.37` by @rufusin. Some patches like `Change flyout panel` toggle type and `Disable HDR auto brightness` won't work as Google removed codebase for those patches to work, the second one is not needed anymore on newer versions.
- [Experimental] `Enable keyword filter` under `Enable custom filter` in General settings. Allows to hide content by keywords (channel and video titles) in the feed and search results. Supports Unicode. This patch is being tested and currently may have issues. You can report if you notice bugs.


# Fixed

- Fix playlist download hook patch when spoofing to older versions by @YT-Advanced
